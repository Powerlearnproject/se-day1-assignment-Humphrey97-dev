#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design, construction, testing, and maintenance of software. It ensures the reliability of the software, efficiency and meets the user’s requirements. It is significant in the field of technology industry in terms of creation of scalable, high quality software solutions, accelerating innovation and in meeting the increasing software needs for many other sectors.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The software engineering evolved from a series of milestones. It was recognized in the 1950s-1960s as a discipline aiming at software complexity. Modular design based on structured programming made the programs more maintainable in 1970s. In the 1990’s Agile methodology became popular and focused around iterative development and have the ability to be flexible to changes in requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
SDLC is composed of many phases. In the first phase of requirement gathering, we try to understand the user needs and document them. Planning on the software architecture and components; is called design. The actual coding is done based on the design, hence development. The tests check if the software had no defects and also ensures the software is up to its requirements. Once built, the software is released to users — that is, it is deployed. Finally, maintenance includes multiple updates, bug fixes, and improvements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a process that moves in a linear sequential order and each phase must be completely finished before passing on to the next. Beyond that, it is best for projects with clearly defined, fixed requirements, for instance, regulatory software. While Agile is iterative and flexible, the development is also done in cycle and allowing for continuous feedback and changes as time progresses. In projects with changing requirements and those projects that require rapid development, like mobile apps, it is perfect. Waterfall is appropriate to projects where everything is defined, while Agile is the way to go for fast paced, dynamic projects.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
As a Software Developer, you are to write, test and maintain the code according to the project requirements. They make sure the software works like it supposed to and solve any problems that arise. A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer tests the software and finds, reports, and corrects the bugs to make sure the product is up to quality standards. They create test cases and automate testing process. Project Manager is responsible for controlling software development process and must ensure that the project is on time and on budget. They are in touch with the stakeholders and ensure the team remains on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are used to make the task of software development easier and more efficient by using a single platform which has tools such as code editors, debuggers and compilers. Such examples are Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA that improves productivity and code quality. Managing the change in the code are Version Control Systems (VCS) for its collaboration as well as for history of code. This helps in not having a conflict while multiple developers are working on one project. VCS or version control system tool is git or SVN that helps in tracking changes, revert changes back to previous versions, and help in collaborative development.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the common challenges faced by a software engineer are the complexity to be managed, meeting the deadlines and dealing with changing requirements. To combat these, engineers can leverage modular design and documentation to help manage the complexity, and adopt Agile development to permit release of functionality in an iterative and flexible way, and communicate adequately with stakeholders to close the gap between expectations and actuality, thus reducing the scope changes. Also, time management tools and good prioritization can allow you to hit deadlines without sacrificing quality.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is used to test individual component or function of the software just to make sure that it is working as intended. Integration testing verifies the interface of different system modules and identify the interface problems. System testing checks the entire application to ensure it does what it supposed to. End user performs acceptance testing to make sure the software meets end user’s needs and works as expected in the real world. These are essential to find bugs, verify functionality, and sustain software quality during the development process.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to instructively interact with AI models in a way that will lead to accurate and satisfactory responses is called prompt engineering. Its value is by making the prompts clear and specific in describing the model’s context and task and the AI can familiarize itself with the task. Prompt engineering, applied well, makes the use of AI models more precise and useful, while also increasing the efficiency and reliability of AI applications.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt: "Tell me about history."
Improved prompt: "Provide a brief overview of the causes and key events of World War I."
Because the improved prompt is more specific in terms of topic (World War I), specific with regard to aspects (causes and key events), and less ambiguous, the AI is given better direction for a targeted and timely response.
